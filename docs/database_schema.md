# StudiesSafari Database Schema Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the StudiesSafari database schema, including tables, relationships, and design considerations.

## Overview

The StudiesSafari database is designed to support a feature-rich Learning Management System (LMS) focused on educational content delivery, user management, and subscription-based access. The schema was implemented through a phased approach:

1. Core Foundation - Users & Authentication
2. Subscriptions & Course Foundation
3. Core Content - Lessons, Quizzes, Past Papers
4. Relationships & Features
5. Profile Completion & Teacher Payouts
6. Enhancements - Progress tracking, Notifications, Gamification

## Design Considerations

### Security

- **Sensitive Data**: Teacher payment details are designed to be encrypted at rest.
- **Authentication**: Leverages Laravel's secure authentication system.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control through the roles system.

### Performance

- **Indexing**: Foreign keys and commonly queried fields are indexed.
- **Denormalization**: Strategic denormalization (e.g., enrollment.progress) for performance.
- **Soft Deletes**: Implemented on critical tables to maintain referential integrity while allowing "deletion".

### Flexibility

- **JSON Fields**: Used for flexible data structures (quiz options, lesson content, etc.).
- **Polymorphic Relationships**: Employed for the payments system to handle different payment contexts.
- **Multiple Access Models**: Supports both subscription-based and one-time purchase access to content.

### Scalability

- **Modular Design**: Tables are logically grouped and related, allowing for feature-based scaling.
- **Background Processing**: Designed with queuing capabilities for handling intensive operations.

## Migrations

The database schema is implemented through Laravel migrations located in `database/migrations/`. These are organized chronologically and grouped by functionality phases.
